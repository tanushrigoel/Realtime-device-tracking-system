A real-time device tracking system built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Socket.io** that visualizes the movement and location of devices in real-time on a map. This project is useful for tracking devices such as phones, GPS units, or any other system with real-time location data.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Tracking**: Visualize the location of connected devices in real-time using websockets.
- **Interactive Map**: Track devices with an interactive map UI (e.g., Google Maps or Leaflet).
- **Socket.io Integration**: Leverage Socket.io for real-time bi-directional communication between client and server.
- **Device Movement Updates**: Receive continuous updates as the devices move across different locations.
- **Scalable Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express.js for easy scalability and maintenance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routes and middleware.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication between the server and client.
- **Leaflet**:  You can integrate **Google Maps**, **Mapbox**, or **Leaflet** for rendering the real-time device locations on a map. I have used leaflet here
